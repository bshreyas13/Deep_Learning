#  Deep Learning 
A repository of Deep Learning Projects and Tasks.

Feel free to use the codes and shoot me a mail in case there are issues.

"Gaussian NB" and Logistic Regression are basic introduction to ML tasks 

Video classification, "Resnet" and "Y-net" are different image classification projects on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. 
These include implementations from scratch of networks for the task and experiments of "Transfer learning"  from pretrained netwroks
