#  Deep Learning 
A repository of Deep Learning Projects and Tasks.

Feel free to use the codes and shoot me a mail in case there are issues.

"Gaussian NB" and Logistic Regression are basic introduction to ML tasks 

Video classification, "Resnet" and "Y-net" are different image classification projects on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. 
"RNN_LSTM for Image Captioning" is a code base that can be used to experiment with various configurations of RNN, LSTM and GRU with various CNNs for the task.  
These include implementations(from scratch) of networks using tenserflow and keras for the task and experiments of "Transfer learning"  from pretrained netwroks
